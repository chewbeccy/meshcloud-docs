To import existing cloud tenants to meshStack into existing company processes, meshStack provides an API to import meshObjects like meshCustomer, meshProject, etc.

## Import

This endpoint allows external systems to use the PUT request method for importing meshObject definitions within a YAML definition. Each section of the definition describes a specific account component. All supported meshDefinitions can be found under [Supported definitions](./meshstack.meshobjects.supported-definitions.md).
